# Numerical Methods
This repository contains a collection of projects developed as part of the Numericall Methods college course

For now this repository contains algorithms for:
* Horner’s Method for Polynomial Evaluation
* Lagrange’s Interpolation
* Gaussian Elimination for Solving Linear Equations
